<h1>About BarSlice</h1>


<h2>Booking group space at bars should be easier!</h2>

<p>Most bars can accomodate groups/parties, but it's often difficult to find exactly what space is available to be booked - e.g. a private room, semi-private space, etc. - and what is required to make the booking - e.g. is there a minimum number of people or minimum spend? - without doing a lot of work.</p>

<h2>Whether planning your next birthday or happy-hour with coworkers, we can help!</h2>

<p>BarSlice lets users find what space at local bars best suits their event by letting each bar showcase the group space they have available and putting it all in one place.  We allow users to book space with participating bars directly on the site, reducing the typical back and forth that takes place in booking an event.</p><br />

<p>BarSlice is currently focussed on New York City, but hoping to bring our service to additional locations.  If you would like to see BarSlice introduced where you live, let us know! Get in touch at <a href="mailto:contact@barslice.com">contact@barslice.com</a></p>
