    <p>BarSlice will facilitate the reservation process through the site.  We are currently building this feature as follows: (1) The user will click the reserve button, which will take them to a reservation request form confirming the event details.  (2) The bar will then receive an email with the event details and a link to either confirm the reservation, deny it, or message the user if more communication is necesarry before making a decision. (3) Once the bar has confirmed the reservation, the user is notified and must accept to complete the reservation.</p>

    <p>Users will be told that upon accepting a reservation, any pending requests to other bars will be cancelled in order to prevent unfullfilled reservations or "no shows" from taking place.</p>

    <p>We welcome any feedback you may have on this feature.  Please send us your thoughts at <a href="mailto:feedback@barslice.com">feedback@barslice.com</a></p>
